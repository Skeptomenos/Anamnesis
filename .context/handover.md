# Handover: v4.2 Defense-in-Depth Complete

## Where We Are
- **Version:** 4.2 (Defense-in-Depth)
- **Status:** Rules restored and fortified in `anamnesis_starter/`

## What Was Accomplished This Session
1. **Restored Lost Rules:** Re-applied Golden Rule #6 (Approval Gate) to `anamnesis_starter/AGENTS.md` after backup revert.
2. **Implemented Handshake Rule:** Added explicit ban on same-turn transitions to kill "Momentum Bias".
3. **Implemented Defense-in-Depth:**
   - Added **T4.3 Handshake (MANDATORY STOP)** to `directives/THINKING.md`
   - Added **Pre-Flight Gate** to `directives/EXECUTION.md`
4. **Updated Learnings:** Documented the "Handshake Rule" and "Defense-in-Depth" success in `PROJECT_LEARNINGS.md`.

## Next Steps
1. **Test v4.2 on real project:** The starter kit is now fully hardened against eager execution.
2. **Tag Release:** v4.2 is ready.
3. **Monitor Efficacy:** Watch if models still try to skip the handshake.
