# 🏁 Handover: Final Documentation Polish (v3.1)

## 📍 Where We Are
*   **Documentation Complete:** `README.md` now features an accurate Directory Tree and Mermaid Diagram reflecting v3.1 logic.
*   **Structure Harmonized:** The split between "Distributable" (`coding/`) and "Instance" (`root`) is fully documented.
*   **State:** The system is clean, stable, and ready for a pilot run.

## 👉 Next Steps
1.  **Pilot:** Execute a complex task using the full v3.1 framework to validate the "Single Source of Truth" flow in practice.
2.  **Monitor:** Check if the "Decision Log" criteria (Dependency/Schema) are clear enough for an AI to self-trigger.
