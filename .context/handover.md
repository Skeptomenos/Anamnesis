# 🏁 Handover: Root File Integration (v3.1.1)

## 📍 Where We Are
- **Root File Architecture:** Implemented progressive disclosure with slim `AGENTS.md` (~100 lines) as canonical root file
- **Multi-CLI Support:** Created templates for OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Claude Code
- **Dogfooding Complete:** knowledge_base project now uses its own `AGENTS.md`
- **Documentation Updated:** README.md rewritten with new structure, CLI setup guide, progressive disclosure explanation

## 👉 Next Steps
1. **Validate:** Test the framework with each CLI tool (OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Claude Code)
2. **Monitor:** Check if progressive disclosure works smoothly (agents reading detailed files when needed)
3. **Iterate:** Gather feedback on `AGENTS.template.md` structure from real-world usage
