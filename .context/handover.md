# 🏁 Handover: Framework Harmonization (v3.1)

## 📍 Where We Are
*   **System Upgrade:** Framework updated to **v3.1.0**.
*   **Structure Harmonized:** All distributable files are now in `coding/`.
    *   `coding/templates/` contains all specs, logs, and state templates.
    *   `coding/PROJECT_LEARNINGS_TEMPLATE.md` is the clean seed.
*   **Logic Refined:**
    *   **Single Source of Truth:** `tasks.md` leads execution; `active_state.md` tracks context.
    *   **Decision Log:** Only for "Fundamental Pivots" (Dependency/Schema/Deprecation).
*   **Project Instance:** `PROJECT_LEARNINGS.md`, `DECISION_LOG.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` for *this* repo are in the root.

## 👉 Next Steps
1.  **Validation:** Use the framework in a real "Pilot" project to verify if the "Single Source of Truth" logic actually reduces friction as intended.
2.  **Monitor:** Watch for "Decision Log" usage. Is the "Dependency/Schema" trigger too strict or too loose?
